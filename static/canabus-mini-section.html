  <h4>Core Operating Modes_TEST</h4>
  <p><strong>Mode 1: Standalone CAN Transceiver &amp; Protocol Translator</strong> Functions as an intelligent gateway, converting proprietary protocols into NMEA 2000 or JSON via Ethernet/Serial using proprietary .dbc files.</p>
  <p><strong>· Use Cases:</strong> Retrofitting legacy control elements and electronics into modern remotely controlled or autonomous systems.</p>
  <p><strong>· Key Features:</strong> DBC file-based parsing, configurable routing, &lt;10ms latency, and control system agnostic.</p>
  <p><strong>Mode 2: ROS/ROS2 Integration Node</strong> Acts as a dedicated hardware node within ROS architectures to expose marine CAN devices as native ROS entities.</p>
  <p><strong>· Use Cases:</strong> Academic autonomy research, multi-sensor fusion, and computer vision/LIDAR integration.</p>
  <p><strong>· Key Features:</strong> Custom device-specific ROS2 nodes, bidirectional sensor/control data flow, and Nav2/MoveIt compatibility.</p>
  <p><strong>Mode 3: Autopilot Integration (ArduPilot/QGC)</strong> Connects industrial CAN hardware to open-source platforms like ArduPilot and QGroundControl.</p>
  <p><strong>· Use Cases:</strong> Utilizing proven autonomy algorithms, waypoint mission planning, and MAVLink telemetry integration.</p>
  <p><strong>· Key Features:</strong> MAVLink bridge for CAN, custom ArduPilot drivers, and support for ArduRover/ArduBoat firmware.</p>
  <p><strong>Mode 4: Fathom Robotics USV Companion Interface (Recommended)</strong> The most complete mode, pairing the device with the KiloWebInterface dashboard for unmanned vessel operations.</p>
  <p><strong>· Use Cases:</strong> Professional commercial USV operations, remote shore-based piloting, and fleet management (coming soon).</p>
  <p><strong>· Key Features:</strong> Zero-install web interface, real-time telemetry with custom widgets, &lt;100ms command latency, mission replay, and modular sensor fusion. Includes advanced payload release capabilities extending beyond the standard ArduPilot scope.</p>

  <h4>CANaBUS Mini: Key Highlights</h4>
  <p><strong>Multi-Protocol Marine Integration:</strong> Interfaces with proprietary CAN protocols from major manufacturers like Volvo Penta, Yamaha, Mercury, Garmin, and Raymarine to eliminate vendor lock-in.</p>
  <p><strong>Triple Independent CAN Architecture:</strong> Features three isolated CAN 2.0B interfaces for simultaneous, conflict-free connection to engine, steering, and navigation subsystems.</p>
  <p><strong>Industrial-Grade Build:</strong> IP67-rated automotive enclosure with marine-grade connectors and conformal-coated PCBs for harsh saltwater protection.</p>
  <p><strong>Real-Time Processing:</strong> Powered by a 600MHz ARM Cortex-M7 delivering &lt;5ms latency, essential for safe autonomous response.</p>
  <p><strong>Flexible Operating Modes:</strong> Supports four modes ranging from simple protocol translation via DBC files to full ROS2 autonomy integration.</p>
  <p><strong>Remote Web Interface:</strong> Native compatibility with the Fathom Robotics USV Companion Interface for real-time telemetry, diagnostics, and piloting from any browser.</p>
